    close to — that line at mid-span.

    Strategy
    --------
    1. Collect ALL line segments inside the plan boundary that are 30–650 pt long
       (any angle — H, V, or diagonal).  Diagonal beams appear in irregular
       framing plans (e.g. Area B skewed grids) and must not be excluded.
    2. For each profile label (cx, cy) find the closest line using perpendicular
       distance: project the label onto the infinite extension of each line and
       measure the distance to the closest point on the segment (±15 % extension
       so labels near span ends still match).  Accept if distance < LABEL_R.
    3. Return a dict  { profile_idx: {"x1","y1","x2","y2","dir","length_pt"} }
       for every profile that was successfully matched to a drawn line.
       dir is "H" / "V" / "D" (diagonal).
       Unmatched profiles fall back to the grid-based span calculation.

    """
    Derive the structural plan extent from grid bubble positions.

    Grid bubbles (letter labels A/B/C… AND number labels 1/2/3…) always appear
    AROUND the perimeter of the structural plan.  Their collective bounding box
    plus a small buffer gives a reliable plan boundary regardless of drawing
    orientation.

    This handles BOTH common layouts transparently:
      • Letters at top/bottom, numbers at left/right   (e.g. "Structural snaps")
      • Letters at left/right, numbers at top/bottom   (e.g. Calsteel drawings)
      • Any mixed layout

    Why NOT separate letter_xs / number_ys (old approach):
      In a "letters-on-left" drawing all letter X values cluster near the left
      edge, so letter_xs gives a ~0-width X range — the plan boundary collapses
      to a sliver and nothing is extracted.

    Detect the small I-section / W-section plan-view symbols drawn in the PDF.

    In structural steel framing plans, each column position is marked with a
    small I or H shaped symbol (two short horizontal lines joined by a vertical
    web line) representing the W-beam cross-section viewed from above.

    Strategy:
      1. Collect all drawing paths whose bounding box is small (5–50 PDF pts).
      2. For each small path, inspect its line segments for both horizontal AND
         vertical components — the defining characteristic of an I/H shape.
      3. Also accept rectangular paths (some CAD exports draw the column symbol
         as a filled or outlined small rectangle with flanges).
      4. Cluster nearby hits and deduplicate.

    #     only 10pt, a 12pt seed-radius misses outer sub-paths.
    #   • A 60pt fixed radius merges real adjacent columns when the drawing scale
    #     is small (columns can be 40-50pt apart on some sheets).

    # EXPANDING CLUSTER solution:

    Rather than assuming "letters are at top/bottom" or "numbers are at
    left/right" (which breaks on Calsteel-style drawings that put letters on
    the left and numbers at the top), we measure the SPREAD of each label
    family within the plan boundary:

      • If the label family spans more in X than in Y → the bubbles form a
        horizontal row at the top or bottom of the plan → they label VERTICAL
        grid lines → contribute their X positions to v_raw.

      • If the family spans more in Y than in X → the bubbles form a vertical
        column at the left or right → they label HORIZONTAL grid lines →
        contribute their Y positions to h_raw.

    This works correctly for both common layouts and any mixed-orientation plan.
